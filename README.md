## Wordle-like game built in Python Tkinter completely from scratch

🧝‍♂️ The goal is to find the combination of 5 characters from J.R.R. Tolkien's "Hobbit" in 6 tries.

🌃 The game supports two languages (Engish and Russian), as well as light and dark color themes.

🎮 To play Hobbitle, clone this repository, open it and run hobbitle.py.

📝 Still a lot of loop holes in the code, hoping to fix them soon!
